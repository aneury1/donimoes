# Donimoes: New Games and Puzzles
When I tell people that I like domino games, they are often surprised to hear
that you can do more than just match the numbers. If you look in a book of
games, often with Mr. Hoyle's name on the cover, you might find the basic game
and maybe All Fives. If you're lucky, you'll find Chickenfoot and Mexican Train.

This book is a collection of domino games and puzzles that will broaden your
horizons beyond a chain of dominoes with matching numbers. You'll find new games
and puzzles that I designed, as well as some of my favourite domino games and
puzzles by other designers:

* **Unmatched Donimoes** is a puzzle I designed where you have to slide all the
    dominoes into a rectangular shape, without sliding any matching numbers next
    to each other.
* **Capturing Donimoes** is a puzzle I designed where you have to collect all the
    dominoes by sliding matching numbers next to each other.
* **Tetradominoes** is a game I designed for one to four players where you play
    matching dominoes in a grid, then try to play the tetromino shapes on top.
    (1-4 players, double-six dominoes, 7 cardboard tetrominoes, and some beads,
    buttons, or coins)
* **Domino Finder** is a memory game I designed where you have to find the
    treasure domino without falling in a trap. (2-4 players,
    double-six dominoes, pawns, and two dice)
* **Mountains and Valleys** is a solitaire game by Sid Sackson where you have to
    lay out a map that you can hike on. I adapted it from paper, pencil, and
    dice to use dominoes.
* **Fujisan** is a solitaire game by James Droscha designed for the piecepack
    game system where you have to help four Shinto priests climb to the peak of
    Mount Fuji. He then adapted it for dominoes and pawns, and I found
    20 layouts that are much more challenging than usual. (1 player, double-six
    dominoes, and four pawns)
* **Cobra Paw** is a quick-reaction game by Derek Weston. (2-4 players,
    double-six dominoes, and two dice)
* **All Fives** is a traditional dominoes game, where you score points by making
    the ends add up to a multiple of five. (2-4 players, double-six dominoes)

## Unmatched Donimoes
A puzzle I designed that's the opposite of traditional dominoes: matches are
forbidden.

### Goal
The goal is to slide all the dominoes into a rectangle, without sliding any
matching numbers next to each other.

### Moves
Move a domino one space along its long axis so that none of its numbers match
an adjacent number on a neighbouring domino. In this example, the lower domino
can move to the right, because the three doesn't match the two, and the four
doesn't match the 3. You couldn't move it another space to the right, because
then the threes would be right next to each other.

      2|3     2|3
    
    3|4       3>4

### Stay Connected
All the dominoes in the puzzle have to be connected in one solid group, diagonal
connections don't count. When you move a domino, it can be disconnected during
the move, as long as it is connected at the start and the end of the move.
Remember that it can only move one space at a time, though.

## Capturing Donimoes
A puzzle I designed to feel like a safari in heavy traffic.

### Goal
The goal is to collect all the dominoes by sliding matching numbers next to
each other.

### Moves
There are only two ways a domino can move: matching and adding.

#### Matching
Move a domino one space along its long axis so that it ends up with at least
one of its numbers matching an adjacent number on a neighbouring domino. Then
collect the domino you moved and any dominoes that match it, by removing them
from the pattern. In this example, the threes match, so you collect both
dominoes: solution found!

    2|3     2|3       2*3
    
    3|4       3>4       3*4

#### Adding
Move a domino one space along its long axis so that it ends up with at least
one of its numbers next to an adjacent number that adds up to six. With an
adding move, no dominoes are removed. In this example, the two adds up with the
four above it to make six.

    3|4     3|4
    
    2|1       2>1

Sometimes, you can collect more than two dominoes at once. In the first
example, the two matches twos on both of the other dominoes, and you collect
all three dominoes. In the second example, the two matches the two to the left,
and the four matches the four above it. You collect all three dominoes.

    5 2|4     5 2|4   5 2*4
    -         -       *
    2   2|6   2 2<6   2 2*6
    
    
    
    5 3|4     5 3|4   5 3*4
    -         -       *
    2   2|4   2 2<4   2 2*4

#### Stay Connected
All the dominoes must stay in one connected group, you can't split the group
after moving or after removing the matching dominoes.

# Domino Games
I really enjoy classic domino games like All Fives, and I've played recent
inventions like Chickenfoot and Mexican Train. However, I thought I might be
able to design a domino game that felt more like a grid than a chain.
Tetradominoes is my attempt to do that.

## Tetradominoes
Play matching dominoes in a grid, then try to play the tetromino shapes on top.

### Players
1 to 4 (See the solitaire rules at the end.)

### Equipment
* a set of dominoes from double blank to double six
* a set of tokens (small chips or cubes that are small enough to fit on top of a
    domino) - 2 players need 1 light token and 1 dark token, 3 players need 3
    tokens in each of 3 colours (9 in total), and 4 players need 2 light tokens
    and 2 dark tokens
* seven cardboard tetrominoes (white on one side, black on the other)

To make your own set of tetrominoes, draw these seven shapes on a piece of
plain cardboard, and cut them out. Use a marker to colour one side of each
shape. Each shape should be big enough fit on top of four domino numbers, with a
small gap around the outside.

### Object
Play the most tetrominoes.

### Setup
Choose a player to go first through any convenient method. In a 2-player game,
the first player takes the light token. The other player takes the dark token.
In a 3-player game, each player takes all the tokens of one colour. In a
4-player game, the first player and the player opposite each take a light token
and the other players take a dark token. Players with the same colour tokens
will play as partners.
 
Shuffle the dominoes face down, and draw four for each player, keeping them
hidden from the other players. Put the remaining dominoes and the tetrominoes
within reach.

### Playing Dominoes
On the first turn, play any domino you like. On each turn after that, you must
play a domino so that at least one of its numbers is adjacent to a matching
number on a domino that was already played, and isn't covered. For example,
the 36 domino can be added as shown, because the 3 matches its neighbour.

    2|3 3
        +
    2 4 6
    - -
    5 5

In this example, the 46 cannot be added in this position, but it could be
flipped to make the 4 match its neighbour.

    2|3 4
        *
    2 4 6
    - -
    5 5

You don't have to match along the long side, you could also play it like this.

    2|3
       
    2 4 4+6
    - -
    5 5

If there are no numbers uncovered at the start of your turn, play a domino so
that at least one of its numbers is adjacent to a covered number (they don't
have to match). If none of your dominoes match the available numbers, reveal two
of your hidden dominoes, and draw one more, keeping it hidden from the other
players. If you still can't play, repeat until you can. If you still can't play
when there are no more dominoes to draw or when you don't have two hidden
dominoes, reveal all of your hidden dominoes, and pass your turn. Leave any
revealed dominoes face up until you play them.

If you have fewer than four dominoes, draw a domino and keep it hidden from the
other players.

### Playing Tetrominoes
After playing a domino, see if you can play a tetromino. It must cover one or
both numbers on the domino you just played, it can't hang off the edge of the
dominoes, and it can't cover any numbers different from the ones on the domino
you just played. Also, two tetrominoes of the same colour can't be right next to
each other. (Diagonal is allowed.)

For example, if you just played the 46 domino, you could play an L-shaped
tetromino on the 4, 4, 4, and 6 numbers.

    2|4
    
      4 4+6
      -
      5

With 2 or 4 players, if you have a light token, you must play tetrominoes with
the light side up. If you have a dark token, you must play with the dark side
up. With three players, all players play tetrominoes with the light side up, and
then place one of their tokens on the tetromino.

With 4 players, after a tetromino is played, the two opposing players may each
take a domino from their hand, and trade with their partner. This is useful if
your partner is about to play and you have a domino that matches something on
the board. It can also be useful when you have two dominoes that will work well
together. However, you can't tell your partner how to play what you give them. 

### Game End
With 2 or 4 players, the game ends when one player or team plays four
tetrominoes and wins. With 3 players, the game ends when one player plays three
tetrominoes and wins.

### Solitaire
All the rules about playing dominoes and tetrominoes stay the same, but you're
trying to fit all of the tetrominoes into a small space. You can play the
tetrominoes either side up, but you get more points if they are mostly the same
colour. If you play a domino that can have a tetromino played on it, you must
play that tetromino. If you can't play any dominoes, discard one tetromino to
count as unplayed, and draw up to four dominoes. Then put the same number of
dominoes back in the pile, and shuffle the pile face down.

**Level 1** - At the end of the game, count the number of black tetrominoes `B`,
the number of white tetrominoes `W`, and the number of unplayed tetrominoes `X`.
Calculate your score as `BxW + 7xX`. You win if your score is less than 10.

**Level 2** - At the end of the game, imagine a rectangle surrounding the
dominoes you played. Count the numbers along the longest side, and add that to
the level 1 score. You win if your total score is less than 15. Good luck!

### Tournament
Tournament play is a series of games until one player wins seven points. One
point for each tetromino.

## Domino Finder
A memory game with hidden traps.

### Players
2-4

### Equipment
* a set of dominoes from double blank to double six
* one pawn for each player, in different colours
* two six-sided dice

### Object
For 2 players, find 7 treasure dominoes. 3 players find 5, or 4 players find 4.

### Setup
Find the 7 dominoes that have blanks, gather them into a pile, and shuffle them
face down. Shuffle the other 21 dominoes face down in a separate pile. Then,
take 1 domino from the blanks pile and 3 from the other pile. Shuffle them
together so you don't know what numbers they have and you don't know which has
a blank. Lay them out face down in a long thin row. Repeat the process until you
have 7 rows side by side, but leave gaps between the rows so you can turn them
over as you play. You should end up with a rectangle of 7x8 secret numbers.

Each player rolls the two dice, and the highest number plays first. Reroll to
break ties. The starting player rolls the two dice to choose the treasure
domino.

### Play
On your first turn, place your pawn next to one of the face down dominoes along
the edge of the board. Every turn, you move your pawn around the board until you
either find the treasure domino or you step in a trap (a blank square). If you
want to move onto a face-down domino, place your pawn next to one end, and then
flip the domino around the long axis, so the numbers stay in the same position.
If you flip over a blank square next to your pawn, then you stepped in a trap!
Place your pawn on the blank square, and your turn is over. If you flip over a
domino that matches the two dice, you found the treasure! Place the treasure
domino face up in front of you, move your pawn into the empty space, and your
turn is over. Otherwise, keep moving around the board and flipping dominoes.
You must stay on the board and move one space at a time. No jumping over blanks,
other pawns, or face-down dominoes. You are allowed to step on spaces where a
domino has already been removed.

When your turn is over, flip all the dominoes you revealed face down again,
except for the one you're standing on. If you found the treasure, roll the two
dice to choose a new treasure. If someone has already found that treasure
domino, roll again. Play passes to the player on your right.

### Winning
As soon as you collect enough treasure, you win the game.

# Domino Puzzles By Other Designers
## Mountains and Valleys
Sid Sackson is one of my favourite game designers, who designed Acquire, Can't
Stop, and I'm the Boss, among many, many others. He included Mountains and
Valleys in his [Beyond Solitaire][solitaire] book, and I adapted it from paper,
pencil, and dice to use dominoes.

To start, shuffle a set of double-six dominoes face down, then turn 18 of them
face up. The remaining 10 aren't used. Then arrange the dominoes into a 6x6
square of numbers that represents a map of mountains and valleys, where blanks
are at sea level, and sixes are the highest peaks. The goal is to make a map
where you can walk to every square. You can walk from one square to its
neighbour if the two heights are the same or differ by one. (You can't climb
cliffs.)

For example, this set of 18 dominoes:

    4 1 3   2 5 2
    - - -   - - -
    2 0 1   0 4 2
    
    3 6 5   5 6 4
    - - -   - - -
    0 0 5   1 3 4
    
    6 1 3   0 1 1
    - - -   - - -
    5 4 3   4 6 2

Can be arranged into this solution:

    0|1 2|1 0|4
    
    2 1|5 4|1 4
    -         -
    0 0|6 4|2 4
    
    0|3 3|3 4|5
    
    1 2 3|6 5|5
    - -
    3 2 1|6 5|6

I like this solitaire, because it can almost always be solved, though finding a
solution can be very difficult. There's usually more than one solution. For
example, you can flip the 56 domino, above. There is a trivially unsolvable
situation whenever one of the numbers from 1 to 5 is completely missing, but
that can be quickly checked, and I haven't found any other unsolvable
combinations.

### Cooperative Version
You can play Mountains and Valleys cooperatively with other players. Shuffle the
dominoes face down, then draw 9, 6, or 5 dominoes each when there are 2, 3, or 4
players, respectively. Keep your dominoes hidden from the other players.

Randomly choose a player to go first. That player chooses one of their dominoes
and passes it to the player on their left. The player receiving the domino plays
it on the table, then chooses one of their dominoes and passes it to the player
on their left. Play continues in the same pattern until a 6x6 square is
complete. After the first domino, all dominoes must be played so they have at
least one neighbour, and they can't be moved after they are added.

When the 6x6 square is complete, see if the whole map is connected as described
in the solitaire game. If you need a step of more than one level to get from one
section of the map to another, you get a penalty of the number of levels. For
example, if a map is completely connected except that you need to go from a 3
to a 5, then you would have a 2 point penalty. A perfect game is zero, and
anything under 5 is a good game.

With four players, the last two players will each have an extra domino left at
the end of the game.

For a harder solitaire version, draw 18 dominoes, but only turn five of them
face up. Each time you play a domino, turn another one face up, until you've
turned up all 18. Then play the last five. Use the same placement and scoring
rules as the cooperative version.

## Fujisan
James Droscha is best known as the designer of the piecepack game system, and
he designed Fujisan for the piecepack, then adapted it for dominoes and pawns in
a paper on [using entangled components in solitaire games][droscha].

Four Shinto Priests have traveled from their various prefectures in pilgrimage
to the top of Mount Fuji. You must find pathways for them to move up and down
the mountain until they can all achieve the peak. Often, this will require you
to guide them into positions from which they can assist each other.

### Setup
Remove all dominoes with the number six and all doubles from a standard set of
double-six dominoes. Shuffle the remaining 15 dominoes face down, then place
twelve face-up dominoes side by side. Leave the three remaining dominoes face
down, and use them to lift up the two middle dominoes as the peak of Mount Fuji.
Here's an example layout:

    5 5 4 3 5 1 2 1 1 2 4 0
    - - - - - - - - - - - -
    3 0 1 4 2 2 0 0 3 4 5 3

Place a Priest (pawn) beside each number at both ends of the mountain.

### Moving a Priest
1. A Priest may move onto a space if the number matches the number of unoccupied
  spaces the Priest must move in a straight line to get there (including the
  destination space itself, but not including the space the Priest's starting
  space). For example, a Priest may move onto a space containing a value 4 coin
  if there are 3 unoccupied spaces between it and the Priest.
2. Occupied spaces (containing intervening Priests) are not counted when
  determining if a Priest may move onto a particular space. For example, a
  Priest may move onto a space containing a value 2 coin if there are 3 occupied
  spaces and one unoccupied space between it and the Priest.
3. A Priest may move freely between the two spaces on a domino. This is the only
  manner in which a Priest may move onto a blank space.
4. Once a Priest lands on the peak of the mountain, he will refuse to leave it,
  but he can move back and forth (in the same domino) or to and fro (between the
  two dominoes). Clarification: A Priest may pass over the peak dominoes as part
  of a move.
5. A Priest must enter the mountain from his own starting row; that is, he
  cannot move back or forth while he remains on the ground.

### Goal
The Priests will be content when they all reach the top of the mountain.

### Variant
Country Road: Once all four Priests have reached the peak, move the dominoes
at the peak to the Priests' original setup positions at the two ends of the
mountain and continue until all four Priests have left the mountain.

Treat the spaces at the peak as blanks. Once a Priest leaves the mountain, he
will not step back on.

length was 14, with half of them between 12 and 16. Here are some more

## Cobra Paw
Derek Weston is a new game designer who designed this cute quick-reaction game
in 2017. I adapted it to use regular dice and dominoes, but the original game
has custom dice and dominoes with some nice design features, so check it out if
you like this basic version.

### Players
2 - 4

### Equipment
* a set of dominoes from double blank to double six
* two six-sided dice

### Object
Collect six dominoes

### Setup
Shuffle all the dominoes face up in the centre of the table.

Any player rolls the dice.

### Play
All players try to find the domino that matches the numbers on the two dice. As
soon as you find it, put one finger on the centre of the domino. Whoever gets
their finger on the domino first, takes it and places it face down in front of
them. Then they roll the two dice to start the next search.

If the domino that matches the dice is already face down, put your finger on the
double blank. If the other players agree that the domino is face down, you can
take any remaining domino except the double blank and place it face down in
front of you. If you're wrong, though, all the other players get to take a
domino! Plus, the player who found the right domino gets to take that as well.

### Winning
The first player to take six dominoes wins the game. If two players take their
sixth domino at the same time, hunt for another domino.

## All Fives
Of the traditional domino games, this is my favourite. It has a lot of the same
appeal as cribbage: some basic arithmetic, and playing the odds. Just make sure
you understand how the sniff works.

### Players
2 - 4

### Equipment
* a set of dominoes from double blank to double six

### Object
Score points by making the ends add up to a multiple of five.

### Setup
Shuffle the dominoes face down, then draw 7 dominoes each, keeping them hidden
from your opponents. (Draw 5 when there are 3 or 4 players.)

### Play
On your turn, you must play a domino with a matching number. In this example,
the 24 domino has just been played. It's a valid move, because its 2 matches the
2 on the open end.

    6|3 3|2 2+4

This example is not valid, because the 4 is played against a number that doesn't
match.

    6|3 3|2 4*2

Dominoes must either be played against an end of the line, or against the sniff.
(The sniff is explained in the rules for doubles.) This example is not valid,
because the 34 domino wasn't played against one of the ends.

    6|3 3|2

        3
        *
        4

### Draw
You may draw extra dominoes before you play one, to give you more options. If
you can't play any of your dominoes, then you must draw extra dominoes until you
get one that you can play. If there are no dominoes left to draw and you can't
play any, then pass your turn.

### Doubles
There are special rules for doubles, and there are extra special rules for the
first double. Most doubles have to be played across the line, like this:

            2         4
    6|3 3|2 - 2|5 5|4 - 4|6
            2         4

Whichever double gets played first is called the sniff, and it has some
differences from the other doubles. You can play against all four sides of the
sniff, so if the 22 domino is the sniff, then a 24 domino could be played on
the 22 domino, but not on the 44 domino.

            2         4
    6|3 3|2 - 2|5 5|4 - 4|6
            2         4
    
            2
            +
            4

The other difference with the sniff is that doesn't have to be played across the
line, you can choose which way to play it. That can make a difference to the
scoring.

### Score
After playing a domino, add up the numbers on the ends. If the total is a
multiple of 5, then add it to your score. This example adds up to 5, and scores
5 points.

        3|2

The next player adds a 63 domino, and the total is 8, no score. You don't count
the 3's, because they're not on the ends.

    6|3 3|2

Now the first double gets played (the sniff). It's played across the line, so
you count both numbers, and the total is 10. Score 10 points!

            2
    6|3 3|2 -
            2

A few turns later, a second double is played. It has to be played across the
line, so you count both numbers. The sniff's ends are still open to play on, so
you count them, and the total is 18. No score.

            2         4
    6|3 3|2 - 2|5 5|4 -
            2         4

The next play is on the regular double, so we stop counting it. The total is
6 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 10. Score 10 points.

            2         4
    6|3 3|2 - 2|5 5|4 - 4|0
            2         4

Don't forget you can play off the sniff. Now the total is 6 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 9. No
score.

            2         4
    6|3 3|2 - 2|5 5|4 - 4|0
            2         4
    
            2
            -
            1

Here's an example where the sniff should be played in line instead of across
the line. Playing across the line would make a total of 14, but playing in line
makes 10 and scores. Don't forget, you can still play off all four sides of the
sniff.

    6|4 4+4

Always keep track of which ends need to be counted: there can be 2, 3, or 4. If
you run out of room on the table, you can bend a line of dominoes around a
corner, but keep track of where the end is.

### Going Out
When a player plays their last domino, they score regularly for that domino,
plus they get points for the dominoes left in other players' hands. Each player
reveals the dominoes in their hand, adds up the numbers, and rounds to the
nearest multiple of 5. The player who went out gets that many points.

If all players pass, then the player with the fewest points left in their hand
goes out. They score the difference between their points and every other
player's points. If there is a tie for fewest points, split the score. Always
round scores to the nearest multiple of 5.

### Winning
If any player has over 200 points after someone goes out, then the player with
the most points wins the game. If there is a tie for the most points, continue
playing.

### Strategy
To make the arithmetic easier, look at the differences between the numbers on
your dominoes. If the current total is 7, then you can score by raising the
total by 3 or dropping it by 2. In this example, the difference between 3 and
6 is 3, so playing it changes the total from 7 to 10.

    4|3 3+6

Particularly in a two-player game, there is a painful rhythm where your opponent
repeatedly scores and you can't. The key to breaking out of that rhythm is to be
able to score on a scoring position. Usually, that means playing a domino with
a difference of 5. Those dominoes are 61, 50, and 55, so they are useful to keep
in your hand.
