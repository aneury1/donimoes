A puzzle where you collect matching dominoes.

Each problem to solve is a pattern of dominoes for you to start from. The goal
is to collect all the dominoes by sliding matching numbers next to each other.

![Beginner problem][example1]

To try the puzzle, get a set of dominoes. Then either [read the rules][rules],
or download [the PDF][pdf]. Choose the PDF if you want to print out pretty
diagrams of the problems, like these:

![Example problem and solution][example2]

On the rules web page, the beginner problem above looks like this:

    0|5 0 1
        - -
    4|6 4 5
    
    4|2 4|1

The example problem and solution look like this:

    5 2|4   5 2|4     5 2|4   5 2*4
    -       -         -       *
    2 2|6   2   2>6   2 2<6   2 2*6

Donimoes is an original puzzle designed by Don Kirkby.

## Other Domino Puzzles ##
The only other domino puzzle I could find is called either Dominosa or Domino
Solitaire. You start with a grid of numbers, and you have to lay the dominoes
on them. It was invented by O.S. Adler in 1874. There's an
[interesting proof][proof] that this puzzle is NP-hard.

Reiner Knizia published some puzzles called [Domino Knobelspass][knizia]
that are very similar to Dominosa.
