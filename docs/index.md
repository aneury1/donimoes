There are two kinds of puzzles: blocking and capturing. The goal of the
blocking puzzle is to slide all the dominoes into a rectangle, without sliding
any matching numbers next to each other. Each problem to solve is a pattern of
dominoes for you to start from, like this:

![Blocking example]

The goal of the capturing puzzle is to collect all the dominoes by sliding
matching numbers next to each other. You can only move dominoes that either
make a capture or add up to six. Here's an example:

To try the puzzle, get a set of dominoes. Then either [read the rules][rules],
or download [the PDF][pdf]. Along with the rules for my puzzles, I've included
some puzzles and games by other designers. Choose the PDF if you want to print out pretty
diagrams of the problems, like these:

On the rules web page, the example problems above look like this:

      2    
      -
      3 1|2
    
    2|4    

and this:

    5 2|4
    -
    2 2|6

The example problem and solution looks like this:

    5 2|4   5 2|4     5 2|4   5 2*4
    -       -         -       *
    2 2|6   2   2>6   2 2<6   2 2*6

Donimoes is an original puzzle designed by Don Kirkby. If you're interested,
you can read about [making donimoes]. If you're brave, you can read about
[experiments] in progress ([PDF][new pdf]).
