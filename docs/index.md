When I tell people that I like domino games, they are often surprised to hear
that you can do more than just match the numbers. If you look in a book of
games, often with Mr. Hoyle's name on the cover, you might find the basic game
and maybe All Fives. If you're lucky, you'll find Chickenfoot and Mexican Train.

This book is a collection of domino games and puzzles that will broaden your
horizons beyond a chain of dominoes with matching numbers. You'll find new games
and puzzles that I designed, as well as some of my favourite domino games and
puzzles by other designers:

* **Unmatched Donimoes** is a puzzle I designed where you have to slide all the
    dominoes into a rectangular shape, without sliding any matching numbers next
    to each other. (1 player, double-six dominoes)
* **Capturing Donimoes** is a puzzle I designed where you have to collect all the
    dominoes by sliding matching numbers next to each other.  (1 player,
    double-six dominoes)
* **Mirror Donimoes** is a puzzle I designed where pawns walk around on top of
    the dominoes. (1 player, double-six dominoes, 4 pawns)
* **Tetradominoes** is a game I designed for one to four players where you play
    matching dominoes in a grid, then try to play the tetromino shapes on top.
    (1-4 players, double-six dominoes, 7 cardboard tetrominoes, and some beads,
    buttons, or coins)
* **Bee Donimoes** is a puzzle race game I designed where a swarm of dice bring
    nectar back to the hive. (1-6 players, double-six dominoes, 3-6 dice, and a
    timer)
* **Domino Finder** is a memory game I designed where you have to find the
    treasure domino without falling in a trap. (2-4 players,
    double-six dominoes, pawns, and two dice)
* **Mountains and Valleys** is a solitaire game by Sid Sackson where you have to
    lay out a map that you can hike on. I adapted it from paper, pencil, and
    dice to use dominoes.
* **Fujisan** is a solitaire game by James Droscha where you help four Shinto
    priests climb to the peak of Mount Fuji. I found 20 layouts that are much
    more challenging than usual. (1 player, double-six dominoes, and four pawns)
* **Cobra Paw** is a quick-reaction game by Derek Weston. (2-4 players,
    double-six dominoes, and two dice)
* **All Fives** is a traditional dominoes game, where you score points by making
    the ends add up to a multiple of five. (2-4 players, double-six dominoes)
* **Dominosa** is the classic domino puzzle by O.S. Adler where you have to fit
    the set of dominoes onto a grid of numbers.

The book of rules includes problems to solve for each puzzle. The Unmatched
Donimoes problems are patterns of dominoes for you to start from, like this:

The Capturing Donimoes problems look like this:

To try the puzzle, get a set of dominoes. Then either [read the rules][rules],
or download [the PDF][pdf].
