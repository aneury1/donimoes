# Donimoes: New Games and Puzzles
When I tell people that I like domino games, they are often surprised to hear
that you can do more than just match the numbers. If you look in a book of
games, often with Mr. Hoyle's name on the cover, you might also find All Fives.
If you're lucky, you'll even find Chickenfoot and Mexican Train.

This book is a collection of new games and puzzles for dominoes that will
broaden your horizons beyond a chain of dominoes with matching numbers:

* **Blocking Donimoes** is a puzzle I designed where you have to slide all the
    dominoes into a rectangular shape, without sliding any matching numbers next
    to each other.
* **Capturing Donimoes** is a puzzle I designed where you have to collect all the
    dominoes by sliding matching numbers next to each other.
* **Tetradominoes** is a game I designed for two to four players where you play
    matching dominoes in a grid, then try to play the tetromino shapes on top.
* **Mountains and Valleys** is a solitaire game by Sid Sackson where you have to
    lay out a map that you can hike on. I adapted it from paper, pencil, and
    dice to use dominoes.
* **Fujisan** is a solitaire game by James Droscha designed for the piecepack
    game system where you have to help four Shinto priests climb to the peak of
    Mount Fuji. He then adapted it for dominoes and pawns, and I found
    20 layouts that are much more challenging than usual.

The book of rules includes problems to solve for each puzzle. The Blocking
Donimoes problems are patterns of dominoes for you to start from, like this:

The Capturing Donimoes problems look like this:

To try the puzzle, get a set of dominoes. Then either [read the rules][rules],
or download [the PDF][pdf]. Choose the PDF if you want to print out pretty
diagrams of the problems, like these:

On the rules web page, the example problems above look like this:

      2    
      -
      3 1|2
    
    2|4    

and this:

    5 2|4
    -
    2 2|6

The example problem and solution looks like this:

    5 2|4   5 2|4     5 2|4   5 2*4
    -       -         -       *
    2 2|6   2   2>6   2 2<6   2 2*6
