# Domiculture #
Domino puzzles where you replant your untidy dominoes into a rectangular garden.

Each puzzle is a pattern of dominoes for you to start from. The goal is to slide
the dominoes until they form a rectangle with no holes. Dominoes can slide
one space at a time toward either of their ends, with two restrictions.

1. Every domino must always have at least one neighbour that matches one of its
    numbers.
2. All the dominoes must be in one connected group, you can't split them.

This project is to build software that will generate interesting problems to
solve.

Domiculture is an original puzzle designed by Don Kirkby.
